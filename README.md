# Miniproject
Accident Prevention System using Arduino is a system that detects some of the circumstances that leads to accident and prevent those accidents by taking necessary measures. This project consists of three modules- Alcohol Detection, Sleep Detection and Overspeed Detection. The System uses Eye Blink Sensor, MQ-3 Sensor and IR Sensor for this purpose. The reading from these sensors are displayed graphically with the help of a ThingSpeak Cloud Platform.
Alcohol Detection
MQ-3 Sensor is used for detecting the presence of alcohol. The system checks whether the driver is drunk or not. If he/she is drunk, the vehicle provides warning by ringing a buzzer and the engine stops functioning. 
Sleep Detection
Eye Blink Sensor is used to detect the sleepy condition of the driver. If the driver is sleepy, the system warns the driver by ringing a buzzer. 
Overspeed Detection
Two IR sensors are used to calculate the speed of the vehicle. One is used as a transmitter and other one as receiver. If the speed is above a certain limit, the system warns the driver with the help of a buzzer.
